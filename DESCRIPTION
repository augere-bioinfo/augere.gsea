Title: Automatic Generation of Gene Set Enrichment Analyses
Description:
    Implements pipelines for generating gene set enrichment analysis reports in the augere framework.
    This includes various competitive and self-contained gene sets from a variety of Bioconductor packages.
    Each pipeline function generates a self-contained Rmarkdown report with all of the steps required to reproduce the gene set enrichment analysis.
