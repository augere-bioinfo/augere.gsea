# Automated generation of gene set enrichment analyses 

Implements pipeline functions to generate parametrized Rmarkdown reports for gene set enrichment analyses.
We support analyses based on pre-computed tables of differential expression results,
or by using **limma** to test for differential gene set activity from the original expression data.
Each report contains all of the R commands required to reproduce the analysis.
